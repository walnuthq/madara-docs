# Madara documentation contents

This repository contains material used to generate the [Madara documentation](https://docs.madara.build) website.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Overview

Madara is both a Starknet full node and an appchain (L3).

The documentation explains all of the functionality of Madara, both from full node perspective and appchain perspective. The documentation is still under development: new sections get added all the time and existing ones get appended to.

## Installation

```
npm i
```

## Local Development

```
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Deployment

The main branch of the repository is automatically deployed to [madara-docs.pages.dev](https://madara-docs.pages.dev/). Additionally, previews are deployed automatically for all PRs, allowing you to review changes before they are merged.

## Updating search index

The search bar utilizes a local search index with [a plugin ](https://github.com/praveenn77/docusaurus-lunr-search).

Whenever needed, the index can be manually updated by: `npm run build`. To see the changes in local development, use `npm run serve`.
