# Overview

A node (client) is the backbone of any blockchain. It runs the blockchain's operations and provides access to the blockchain.

Running your own node servers either of these two purposes:
1. Provides you with access to an existing blockchain. Typically the Starknet L2.
1. Participates in creating a completely new blockchain. This can be either a production blockchain or a local devnet.
