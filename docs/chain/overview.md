# Overview

A chain operator is responsible for running and maintaining a Madara blockchain. A new blockchain can be started simply by becoming the first chain operator for a network.

Chain operator's responsibilities include configuring their part of the network, making sure the necessary components are running and managing interoperability with external components.

## Layer 2 or Layer 3

Madara can launch either a Starknet clone (a L2 network) or a new network on top of a Starknet network, which is also called an Application Chain (App Chain or L3). The basic functionality remains mostly the same, the main difference is the settlement layer.
