# Validity rollup

## Overview

- A L2 (or L3, ...) scaling solution: moves computation off-chain
- Transactions are batched and then 'summarized'
- Explain prover/verifier cooperation
- Blocks are accepted based on verified proofs

## Also known as a ZK-rollup

- Also known as a Zero Knowledge rollup (but explain a bit why that term is misleading)

## Validity rollup security

- Mathematics guarantees integrity. No invalid state transitions possible
- Malicious actors can only censor
- Escape hatch: users can always (in theory) bypass all components and reclaim assets on the SL
