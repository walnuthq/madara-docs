# Welcome to the Madara Docs

Welcome to the Madara documentation, a unified resource for documentation related to the Madara node and appchain.

## Starknet node or a new chain

Madara has two main purposes: to run a regular node in Starknet or to launch a new appchain, based on Starknet technology.

In this site you can find all the needed information for both use cases.
