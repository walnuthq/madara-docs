# Overview

Welcome to the Madara documentation, a unified resource for documentation related to the Madara node and appchain.

## Starknet node and a new chain

Madara has two main purposes: to run a regular node in Starknet or to launch a new appchain, based on Starknet technology.

## How does Madara compare to Starknet

Madara is an official implementation of the [Starknet Stack](https://www.starknet.io/blog/the-case-for-appchains).

The live Starknet chain utilizes closed source components, while Madara is fully open source. Anyone is free to customize anything with Madara as they see fit and contributions are very welcome.

With Madara, one can either run a Starknet clone (a Layer 2 blockchain) or a separate Layer 3 Application Chain (Appchain or L3). Everything is based on the Starknet Stack.

## How to choose network type

Whether you want to run a Layer 2 or a Layer 3 blockchain depends on your needs. Running a L2 blockchain gives you a lot of flexibility, but requires you to be very careful with your network setup.

Running a L3 blockchain benefits from both L1 (Ethereum) and L2 (Starknet) and is easier to manage. On the other hand, it also restricts you to both L2 and L3 requirements.
