# Overview

Welcome to the Madara documentation, a unified resource for documentation related to the Madara appchain.

## What is Madara

Madara is an official implementation of the [SN Stack](https://www.starknet.io/sn-stack/). It allows anyone to start a new appchain that settles either to Ethereum or to Starknet.

The live Starknet chain utilizes closed source components, while Madara is fully open source. Anyone is free to customize anything with Madara as they see fit and contributions are very welcome.
