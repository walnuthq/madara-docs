# Run an appchain

## Overview

This guide will help you run an Appchain with Madara.

The deployed components are only available locally and are meant for testing purposes.

## Install Madara CLI and run the Appchain

Go run the [local chain](/quickstart/run_localchain) guide. When prompted for "Madara mode", instead of choosing `Devnet` choose `Appchain`.

After you've chosen `AppChain`, the CLI will ask to choose the prover. You should choose `Dummy` - this will essentially skip proving transactions completely.

Congratulations, you now have a functioning Appchain running!
